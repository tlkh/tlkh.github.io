==============

This is the code repository for my personal portfolio site, which I host using GitHub pages. You shouldn't be here. Visit my site at [tlkh.github.io](http://tlkh.github.io/)

If you're here to check out the code however, feel free to do so!

Work based on Aerial and Prologue by @n33co on [HTML5up](http://html5up.net). Check it out!
